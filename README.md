# [Streamer Bot Client](https://streamerbot.github.io/client/get-started/installation) functionality test project
This is a testing ground for me while I experiment with the streamer bot Websocket API and its possible use cases.

## Focus
 The main testing goals and features I hope to develop are:
 - Cross platform compatibility, especially with youtube event handlers
 - Making projects that enable backwards compatibility between existing products and streamer bot
 - Learning the structure of Streamer Bot Client

## Prerequisites and Setup
Prerequisites:
- It is important to note that any code in this repo will only run adequately when paired with the [Streamerbot desktop application](https://streamer.bot/)
- the Streamerbot Websocket server must be set up and running [[ see setup details](https://streamerbot.github.io/client/get-started/setup)]

Setup:
- Development Environment Initialization 
`npm install`

- Browser Server Startup
`npm run dev`
